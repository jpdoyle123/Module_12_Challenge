# Module_12_Challenge

In this challenge, we were tasked with comparing two logistic regression models with supervised learning. For the first model, we looked at the original training and testing data, and made a logistic fit to predict our target features. The code is shown below, as well as the imported libraries.

For the second model, we used an oversampling method, as the data points were misaligned for our features. We use RandomOversampler to oversample the data, and then run another logistic regression to see if our accuracy scores improve.
